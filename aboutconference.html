        <p>The Department of Mathematics, P.G.D.A.V. College is  organizing a national conference entitled <strong>“National Conference on Advances in Mathematical Analysis and its Applications”</strong>(NCAMAA-2019) during November 8-10, 2019.
        </p>
        
        <p>The objective of the conference is to bring together mathematicians from all around the country working in the area of mathematical analysis and to provide a platform to build future collaborative activities. The conclusions will provide a direction towards further research and development in the areas of mathematical analysis and its applications in other branches of science, engineering and technology such as bio-technology and computer sciences. The conference shall serve as a forum for fruitful deliberations and exchange of ideas to a wide audience of distinguished professors and research scholars</p>
        
        <p>Representative areas of the conference include, but are not restricted to </p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Multivariable analysis</li>
        <li>Matrix and Fourier analysis</li>
        <li>Analysis in the theory of operators</li>
        <li>Real and Complex Analysis</li>
        <li>Spectral analysis of non-self adjoint operators</li>
        <li>Harmonic analysis </li>
        <li>Operator spaces and their applications</li>
